Key Business Insights
1. Department Attrition
Research & Development records the highest attrition count (133 employees). Potential workload and career growth concerns should be investigated.

2. Overtime Impact
Employees working overtime show approximately 30% attrition compared to 10% among employees without overtime.

3. Age Group Analysis
Young employees demonstrate elevated attrition patterns indicating possible early career dissatisfaction.

4. Salary & Job Role
Managers and Research Directors earn significantly more than operational roles.

5. High Risk Employees
Employees with overtime and low satisfaction require early intervention.

6. Correlation Findings
Monthly income strongly correlates with JobLevel and TotalWorkingYears.

Business Recommendations
Reduce overtime burden
Improve career growth opportunities
Review compensation structures
Strengthen employee engagement programs
